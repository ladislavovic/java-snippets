// Closure
//
// Closure is reference to the function with a referencing environment.

// Example 1
var outer = function() {
  var a = 1;
  var inner = function() {
    alert(a);
  }
  return inner;
}

fnc = outer(); // A
fnc();

// The function on the line "A" returns the reference to the function.
// The function has its own scope (environment). Normally, the sope would
// be romoved from the stack, because the outer function exited. But it
// returned the reference to the inner function and scope still exists.
