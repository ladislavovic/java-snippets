        This file contains definition of persistence units. A JPA
        Persistence Unit is a logical grouping of user defined persistable
        classes (entity classes, embeddable classes and mapped superclasses)
        with related settings.

        Persistence units are defined in a persistence.xml file,
        which has to be located in the META-INF directory in the classpath.
        
        Usually it contains information about persistence provider
        and list of mapped classes. Classes, which are int the same
        jar, which contains persistence.xml are found automatically,
        other classes must be specified. But some JPA providers automatically
        search through  classpath and search all mapped classes. So
        you do not have to declare these classes.
