/**
 * Yen's algorithm computes single-source K-shortest loopless paths for a graph using an underlying
 * shortest path algorithm passed as a parameter. The algorithm was published by Jin Y. Yen in 1971
 * and employs any shortest path algorithm to find the best path, then proceeds to find K-1
 * deviations of the best path.
 * <p>
 * Based on pseudocode published on
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yen%27s_algorithm">Wikipedia</a>
 *
 * <p>
 * This implementation will hold a strong reference to all shortest paths returned so far. The
 * algorithm pre-calculates and stores a small number of next shortest paths that is needed to
 * determine the actual next shortest path.
 *
 * <p>
 * The shortest path algorithm to determine the paths may be passed as a parameter. Any constraint
 * of that algorithm must be obeyed, e.g. the default {@link DijkstraShortestPath} will not allow
 * negative edge weights.
 *
 * <p>
 * The time complexity of the algorithm depends on the chosen shortest path algorithm. With the
 * default @link {@link DijkstraShortestPath} which uses Fibonacci heaps the complexity is $O(K N (M
 * + N log N))$, where N is the number of edges and M is the number of vertices.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class uses {@link YenShortestPathsIterator_Custom} to perform the actual work.
