JGraphT
=============
* self-loops - edges which connect a vertex to itself
* simple graph - graph which does not allows self-loops and multiple edges
* multiple edges - allows more than one edge between the same vertex pair. In a directed graph, two edges between the 
  same vertex pair but with opposite direction do not count as multiple edges
