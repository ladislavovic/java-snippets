/**
 * A facade is an object that provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code,
 * such as a class library. It is just a class which have references to other classes. A
 * facade can:
 * <ul>
 * <li>make a software library easier to use, understand, and test, since the facade has
 * convenient methods for common tasks</li>
 * <li>make the library more readable</li>
 * <li>reduce dependencies of outside code on the inner workings of a library, since most
 * code uses the facade, thus allowing more flexibility in developing the system</li>
 * <li>wrap a poorly designed collection of APIs with a single well-designed API</li>
 * </ul>
